A README report on the AirBNB project!


***Project Description***

This Airbnb Clone is the first main project at ALX Software Engineering Programme. The aim is to develop an entire web application that simulates the behavior of the Airbnb platform. Starting from the console or command interpreter, to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging), followed by the construction of a website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic, once it's finished what follows is the connection with the database or files that store data (data = objects). And last but not least, the creation of an API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).


***Requirements***

Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)



***The Console***

HTML, My SQL HTML with Fabric Flask web application server REST API WEB Dynamic Functionalities of this command interpreter: Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place) Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc... Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc...) Update attributes of an object Destroy an object

Storage Instances of classes are saved in a JSON string representation to the file.json file at the root directory. Any modifications (additions, deletions, updates) to the objects are saved automatically to the file. The JSON file serves as a simple database that helps the data persist across sessions.
